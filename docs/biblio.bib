	abstract = {Motivated by empirical observations of spatio-temporal clusters of crime across a wide variety of urban settings, we present a model to study the emergence, dynamics, and steady-state properties of crime hotspots. We focus on a two-dimensional lattice model for residential burglary, where each site is characterized by a dynamic attractiveness variable, and where each criminal is represented as a random walker. The dynamics of criminals and of the attractiveness field are coupled to each other via specific biasing and feedback mechanisms. Depending on parameter choices, we observe and describe several regimes of aggregation, including hotspots of high criminal activity. On the basis of the discrete system, we also derive a continuum model; the two are in good quantitative agreement for large system sizes. By means of a linear stability analysis we are able to determine the parameter values that will lead to the creation of stable hotspots. We discuss our model and results in the context of established criminological and sociological findings of criminal behavior.},

Although our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the emergence and diffusion of crime is still incomplete, recent research highlights applied mathematics and methods of statistical physics as valuable theoretical resources that may help us better understand criminal activity. We review different approaches aimed at modeling and improving our understanding of crime, focusing on the nucleation of crime hotspots using partial differential equations, self-exciting point process and agent-based modeling, adversarial evolutionary games, and the network science behind the formation of gangs and large-scale organized crime. We emphasize that statistical physics of crime can relevantly inform the design of successful crime prevention strategies, as well as improve the accuracy of expectations about how different policing interventions should impact malicious human activity that deviates from social norms. We also outline possible directions for future research, related to the effects of social and coevolving networks and to the hierarchical growth of criminal structures due to self-organization.},

In addition to the supercritical spots already shown to exist in our previous work, we prove here the existence of subcritical hotspots that arise via subcritical pitchfork bifurcations or transcritical bifurcations, depending on the geometry. We present numerical results that both validate our analytical findings and confirm the existence of these subcritical hotspots as stable states. Finally, we examine the differences between these two types of hotspots with regard to attempted hotspot suppression, referencing the varying levels of success such attempts have had in real world scenarios.},

As a consequence, the ability of law enforcement agencies to use mapped crime patterns to design crime prevention strategies is severely hampered. We also lack robust expectations about how different policing interventions should impact crime. Here we present a mathematical framework based on reaction-diffusion partial differential equations for studying the dynamics of crime hotspots. The system of equations is based on empirical evidence for how offenders move and mix with potential victims or targets. Analysis shows that crime hotspots form when the enhanced risk of repeat crimes diffuses locally, but not so far as to bind distant crime together. Crime hotspots may form as either supercritical or subcritical bifurcations, the latter the result of large spikes in crime that override linearly stable, uniform crime distributions. Our mathematical methods show that subcritical crime hotspots may be permanently eradicated with police suppression, whereas supercritical hotspots are displaced following a characteristic spatial pattern. Our results thus provide a mechanistic explanation for recent failures to observe crime displacement in experimental field tests of hotspot policing.},

	abstract = {Given a discrete sample of event locations, we wish to produce a probability density that models the relative probability of events occurring in a spatial domain. Standard density estimation techniques do not incorporate priors informed by spatial data. Such methods can result in assigning significant positive probability to locations where events cannot realistically occur. In particular, when modelling residential burglaries, standard density estimation can predict residential burglaries occurring where there are no residences. Incorporating the spatial data can inform the valid region for the density. When modelling very few events, additional priors can help to correctly fill in the gaps. Learning and enforcing correlation between spatial data and event data can yield better estimates from fewer events. We propose a non-local version of maximum penalized likelihood estimation based on the H1 Sobolev seminorm regularizer that computes non-local weights from spatial data to obtain more spatially accurate density estimates. We evaluate this method in application to a residential burglary dataset from San Fernando Valley with the non-local weights informed by housing data or a satellite image.},

Space–time clustering is modeled in seismology by self-exciting point processes and the focus of this article is to show that these methods are well suited for criminological applications. We first review self-exciting point processes in the context of seismology. Next, using residential burglary data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, we illustrate the implementation of self-exciting point process models in the context of urban crime. For this purpose we use a fully nonparametric estimation methodology to gain insight into the form of the space–time triggering function and temporal trends in the background rate of burglary.},

If automated, data-driven tools for crime pattern detection are made available to assist analysts, these tools could help police to better understand patterns of crime, leading to more precise attribution of past crimes, and the apprehension of suspects. To do this, we propose a pattern detection algorithm called Series Finder, that grows a pattern of discovered crimes from within a database, starting from a “seed” of a few crimes. Series Finder incorporates both the common characteristics of all patterns and the unique aspects of each specific pattern, and has had promising results on a decade’s worth of crime pattern data collected by the Crime Analysis Unit of the Cambridge Police Department.},

	abstract = {Containing the spreading of crime is a major challenge for society. Yet, since thousands of years, no effective strategy has been found to overcome crime. To the contrary, empirical evidence shows that crime is recurrent, a fact that is not captured well by rational choice theories of crime. According to these, strong enough punishment should prevent crime from happening. To gain a better understanding of the relationship between crime and punishment, we consider that the latter requires prior discovery of illicit behavior and study a spatial version of the inspection game. Simulations reveal the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance between “criminals”, “inspectors”, and “ordinary people” as a consequence of spatial interactions. Such cycles dominate the evolutionary process, in particular when the temptation to commit crime or the cost of inspection are low or moderate. Yet, there are also critical parameter values beyond which cycles cease to exist and the population is dominated either by a stable mixture of criminals and inspectors or one of these two strategies alone. Both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions to different final states are possible, indicating that successful strategies to contain crime can be very much counter-intuitive and complex. Our results demonstrate that spatial interactions are crucial for the evolutionary outcome of the inspection game, and they also reveal why criminal behavior is likely to be recurrent rather than evolving towards an equilibrium with monotonous parameter dependencies.},

This practice has shown evidence of reducing crime in the hotspot area. While it is possible that the benefits of such reduction might be diffused to the surrounding areas, one criticism of this practice is that the crime in the hotspot may also be displaced to the surrounding areas. A number of empirical studies have investigated the spatial pattern of crime displacement. However, few have attempted to uncover the mechanisms that lead to the displacement of crime. In this paper we present a theory-driven approach that applies agent-based modeling to simulate the mechanism of crime and policing. The processes that drive possible displacement of crime are investigated through experiments in a computational laboratory—{SPACES}. Our results reveal that crime cannot be displaced easily because opportunities for crime are limited in low-crime areas and offenders are often attached to the area where they perform their routine activities.},

	abstract = {Occurrences of crime are complex phenomena. They are the result of a large number of interrelated elements which can include environmental factors as well as complex human behaviours. Traditionally, crime occurrences have been modelled using statistical techniques, and although such approaches are useful, they face difficulties in providing predictive analyses and with the integration of behavioural information. Also, it is particularly difficult to account for the strongly influential effect of local urban form. Agent-based modelling is a relatively new modelling paradigm that has generated a considerable amount of interest. An agent is an independent component of a system which interacts with other agents and its environment to achieve goals. In this manner, large systems of agents can be created to mimic real scenarios. Most importantly, the agents can incorporate behavioural information to determine how they should achieve their goals, and models can include a highly detailed environment. This paper presents an agent-based model used to predict burglary rates, which, despite its simplicity, yields interesting results. We apply the model to the city of Leeds, {UK}. The model indicates that the urban configuration in Leeds is a major element in determining the level of crime across the city. It also demonstrates that agent-based modelling is an excellent tool for these types of analyses with much potential.},

	abstract = {{ObjectivesDecades} of empirical research demonstrate that crime is concentrated at a range of spatial scales, including street segments. Further, the degree of clustering at particular geographic units remains noticeably stable and consistent; a finding that Weisburd (Criminology 53:133–157, 2015) has recently termed the ‘law of crime concentration at places’. Such findings suggest that the future locations of crime should—to some extent at least—be predictable. To date, methods of forecasting where crime is most likely to next occur have focused either on area-level or grid-based predictions. No studies of which we are aware have developed and tested the accuracy of methods for predicting the future risk of crime at the street segment level. This is surprising given that it is at this level of place that many crimes are committed and policing resources are deployed.{MethodsUsing} data for property crimes for a large {UK} metropolitan police force area, we introduce and calibrate a network-based version of prospective crime mapping [e.g. Bowers et al. (Br J Criminol 44:641–658, 2004)], and compare its performance against grid-based alternatives. We also examine how measures of predictive accuracy can be translated to the network context, and show how differences in performance between the two cases can be quantified and tested.{ResultsFindings} demonstrate that the calibrated network-based model substantially outperforms a grid-based alternative in terms of predictive accuracy, with, for example, approximately 20 \% more crime identified at a coverage level of 5 \%. The improvement in accuracy is highly statistically significant at all coverage levels tested (from 1 to 10 \%).{ConclusionsThis} study suggests that, for property crime at least, network-based methods of crime forecasting are likely to outperform grid-based alternatives, and hence should be used in operational policing. More sophisticated variations of the model tested are possible and should be developed and tested in future research.},

	abstract = {A fundamental issue in crime prevention is the efficient deployment of resources and the effective targeting of interventions, both of which require some form of prediction of future crime. One crime for which this is feasible is burglary, the distinctive spatio-temporal signatures of which can be exploited to inform predictions. Mathematical models in particular are capable of both encoding concisely the theoretical foundations of criminal behaviour and allowing the quantitative analysis of specific scenarios, and their capacity to reproduce the general patterns of burglary suggests that the approach has considerable potential. Previous models, however, are situated on simplified representations of space and do not reflect realistically the built environment in which crime takes place; specifically, they do not incorporate urban street networks. Such networks are fundamental to situational theories of crime, in the sense that they determine the configuration of urban space and, therefore, shape those human activity patterns which are thought to give rise to crime. Furthermore, streets are the natural domain for many policing activities, and their structure is determined by planning decisions, so that insight into their relationship with crime is likely to be of immediate practical use. With this in mind, this paper presents a mathematical model of crime which is explicitly situated on a street network. After discussing theoretical considerations and specifying the model itself, examples of typical networks are explored.},

However, significant barriers related to data and methods exist for conducting this type of research. The research requires micro-level data about individual behavior that is difficult to obtain and methods capable of modeling the dynamic, spatio-temporal interaction of offenders, victims, and potential guardians at the micro level. This paper presents simulation modeling as a method for addressing these challenges. Specifically, agent-based modeling, when integrated with geographic information systems, offers the ability to model individual behavior within a real environment. The method is demonstrated by operationalizing and testing routine activity theory as it applies to the crime of street robbery. Model results indicate strong support for the basic premise of routine activity theory; as time spent away from home increases, crime will increase. The strength of the method is in providing a research platform for translating theory into models that can be discussed, shared, tested and enhanced with the goal of building scientific knowledge.},

Although there are several factors which influence the dynamics of the spread of crime in a society, it is an established fact that crime spreads in a society like an infectious disease. Here, a nonlinear mathematical model is formulated and analyzed to study the dynamics of crime by considering simple mass-action type incidence and constant recruitment and death type demography. The basic reproduction number R0 of the proposed model is computed and all possible equilibria of the model are obtained. Stability analysis of the model is discussed in detail. The nontrivial equilibrium exists only when the basic reproduction number R0{\textgreater}1 and it is locally asymptotically stable under some restriction on parameters. Further, this model is extended to delay differential equation model by incorporating the delay in catching the criminals. In the presence of delay the local stability of nontrivial equilibrium point is preserved only upto certain value of delay and beyond this Hopf-bifurcation occurs and the model system exhibits oscillatory behavior. Further, the {ODE} model is converted to stochastic model and results of stochastic and deterministic models are compared using numerical simulation.},

In reality, criminals move in confined areas with a maximum jump length. In this paper, we develop a mean-field continuum model with truncated Lévy flights ({TLFs}) for residential burglary in one-space dimension. The continuum model yields local Laplace diffusion, rather than fractional diffusion. We present an asymptotic theory to derive the continuum equations and show excellent agreement between the continuum model and the agent-based simulations. This suggests that local diffusion models are universal for continuum limits of this problem, the important quantity being the diffusion coefficient. Law enforcement agents are also incorporated into the model, and the relative effectiveness of their deployment strategies are compared quantitatively.},

Moreover, observed chaos analysis is considered a second step to pinpoint the nature of the underlying crime dynamics. This approach is carried out on a long database of burglary activity reported by 10 police districts of San Francisco city.

Within the context of this model, we show that gang clustering and territory formation may arise under specific parameter choices and that a phase transition may occur between well-mixed, possibly dilute configurations and well separated, clustered ones. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the phase transition between these two qualitatively different scenarios. In the mean-fields rendition of this model, we identify parameter regimes where the transition is first or second order. In all cases, we have found that the transitions are a consequence solely of the gang to graffiti couplings, implying that direct gang to gang interactions are not strictly necessary for gang territory formation; in particular, graffiti may be the sole driving force behind gang clustering.

In this model, agents represent gang members and move according to a biased random walk, adding graffiti with some probability as they move and preferentially avoiding the other gang’s graffiti. All agent interactions are indirect, with the interactions occurring through the graffiti field. We show numerically that as parameters vary, a phase transition occurs between a well-mixed state and a well-segregated state. The numerical results show that system mass, decay rate and graffiti rate influence the critical parameter. From the discrete model, we derive a continuum system of convection–diffusion equations for territorial development. Using the continuum equations, we perform a linear stability analysis to determine the stability of the equilibrium solutions and we find that we can determine the precise location of the phase transition in parameter space as a function of the system mass and the graffiti creation and decay rates.},

While it is a hard task to extract causality from data, several linear models have been proposed to predict crime through the existing correlations between crime and urban metrics. However, because of non-Gaussian distributions and multicollinearity in urban indicators, it is common to find controversial conclusions about the influence of some urban indicators on crime. Machine learning ensemble-based algorithms can handle well such problems. Here, we use a random forest regressor to predict crime and quantify the influence of urban indicators on homicides. Our approach can have up to 97\% of accuracy on crime prediction, and the importance of urban indicators is ranked and clustered in groups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data sample analyzed. Our results determine the rank of importance of urban indicators to predict crime, unveiling that unemployment and illiteracy are the most important variables for describing homicides in Brazilian cities. We further believe that our approach helps in producing more robust conclusions regarding the effects of urban indicators on crime, having potential applications for guiding public policies for crime control.},

Predictive analysis aims to optimize the use of these data to anticipate criminal events. It utilizes specific statistical methods to predict the likelihood of new crime events at small spatiotemporal units of analysis. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of applying predictive analysis in an urban context. To this end, the available crime data for three types of crime (home burglary, street robbery, and battery) are spatially aggregated to grids of 200 by 200 m and retrospectively analyzed. An ensemble model is applied, synthesizing the results of a logistic regression and neural network model, resulting in bi-weekly predictions for 2014, based on crime data from the previous three years. Temporally disaggregated (day versus night predictions) monthly predictions are also made. The quality of the predictions is evaluated based on the following criteria: direct hit rate (proportion of incidents correctly predicted), precision (proportion of correct predictions versus the total number of predictions), and prediction index (ratio of direct hit rate versus proportion of total area predicted as high risk). Results indicate that it is possible to attain functional predictions by applying predictive analysis to grid-level crime data. The monthly predictions with a distinction between day and night produce better results overall than the bi-weekly predictions, indicating that the temporal resolution can have an important impact on the prediction performance.},

Here we report on a characterization of the spatial dynamics of the homicide crimes along the Brazilian territory using data from all cities in a period of more than thirty years. Our results show that the spatial correlation function in the per capita homicides decays exponentially with the distance between cities and that the characteristic correlation length displays an acute increasing trend in the latest years. We also investigate the formation of spatial clusters of cities via a percolation-like analysis, where clustering of cities and a phase-transition–like behavior describing the size of the largest cluster as a function of a homicide threshold are observed. This transition-like behavior presents evolutive features characterized by an increasing in the homicide threshold (where the transitions occur) and by a decreasing in the transition magnitudes (length of the jumps in the cluster size). We believe that our work sheds new light on the spatial patterns of criminal activities at large scales, which may contribute for better political decisions and resources allocation as well as opens new possibilities for modeling criminal activities by setting up fundamental empirical patterns at large scales.},

The model can thus evaluate the strategies’ effectiveness and collateral effects before putting them into practice and provide support for the policing decision-making process.

This paper presents the construction and application of an agent-based model ({ABM}) for simulating occurrences of residential burglary at an individual level. It presents a novel framework that allows both human and environmental factors to be simulated. Although other agent-based models of crime do exist, this research represents the first working example of integrating a behavioural framework into an {ABM} for the simulation of crime. An artificial city, loosely based on the real city of Leeds, {UK}, and an artificial population were constructed, and experiments were run to explore the potential of the model to realistically simulate the main processes and drivers within this system. The results are highly promising, demonstrating the potential of this approach for both understanding processes behind crime and improving policies and developing effective crime prevention strategies.},

While geographic information systems ({GISs}) have been very successful at tracking criminal activity, proactive law enforcement requires systems that anticipate the emergence of criminal activity. One such system under development at Carnegie Mellon University and the Pittsburgh ({PA}) Bureau of Police is an early warning system that incorporates a {GIS}, previously developed to track criminal activity, and a relatively new technology — artificial neural networks — to predict the emergence or \&quot;flare ups \&quot; of drug hot-spot areas. The system obtains its input from cell-aggregated {GIS}-based data, processes the data with a previously trained artificial neural network and outputs the results to a choropleth map indicating those areas for which the network has predicted a relatively high number of 911 calls for service for drugs. The focus of this paper is to describe how the early warning system was developed, and to explain some of the underlying theory behind neural networks. In addition, the performance of the network is compared to some of the more traditional geographic forecasting methods.},

	abstract = {Crime is a major social problem in the United States, threatening public safety and disrupting the economy. Understanding patterns in criminal activity allows for the prediction of future high-risk crime “hot spots” and enables police precincts to more effectively allocate officers to prevent or respond to incidents. With the ever-increasing ability of states and organizations to collect and store detailed data tracking crime occurrence, a significant amount of data with spatial and temporal information has been collected. How to use the benefit of massive spatial-temporal information to precisely predict the regional crime rates becomes necessary. The recurrent neural network model has been widely proven effective for detecting the temporal patterns in a time series. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal neural network ({STNN}) to precisely forecast crime hot spots with embedding spatial information. We evaluate the model using call-for-service data provided by the Portland, Oregon Police Bureau ({PPB}) for a 5-year period from March 2012 through the end of December 2016. We show that our {STNN} model outperforms a number of classical machine learning approaches and some alternative neural network architectures.},

These have been developed for different contexts such as public facilities in smart cities, health care, traffic congestions, e-commerce, financial security, user-generated content, and crowdsourcing. In {GIScience}, problems related to routing systems have been deeply explored by using several techniques, but they are not focused on security or crime rates. In this paper, an approach to provide estimations defined by crime rates for generating safe routes in mobile devices is proposed. It consists of integrating crowd-sensed and official crime data with a mobile application. Thus, data are semantically processed by an ontology and classified by the Bayes algorithm. A geospatial repository was used to store tweets related to crime events of Mexico City and official reports that were geocoded for obtaining safe routes. A forecast related to crime events that can occur in a certain place with the collected information was performed. The novelty is a hybrid approach based on semantic processing to retrieve relevant data from unstructured data sources and a classifier algorithm to collect relevant crime data from official government reports with a mobile application.},

	abstract = {{ResumenEste} artículo tiene como objetivo analizar los patrones espaciales del delito de robo de vehículos en la Ciudad de México. Las grandes áreas metropolitanas de America Latina han atestiguado el incremento de la violencia urbana y la Zona Metropolitana de la Ciudad de México ({ZMCM}) no es la excepción. Uno de los delitos con el mayor número de averiguaciones previas en la {ZMCM} es el robo de vehículos con un promedio de 40 336 durante el periodo 1995-2007. En 2010 el robo de vehículos alcanzo las 44 446 averiguaciones previas, representando el 38\% del total de las averiguaciones previas registradas en la entidad. Sin embargo, este delito no muestra una distribución homogénea en todo el territorio sino que muestra una alta concentración en algunas delegaciones de la Ciudad de México como Benito Juárez, Coyoacán y Cuauhtémoc. En este contexto nos preguntamos. Existe relación espacial entre la concentración de los robos de vehículos y las características socioeconómicas del entorno? El soporte teórico del artículo lo proporcionan teorías como la desorganización social y las actividades rutinarias. La información usada del robo de vehículos corresponde a las denuncias hechas por las personas afectadas y que se convirtieron en averiguaciones previas, la fuente de información es la Procuraduría General de Justicia del Distrito Federal ({PGJDF}, 2010). El resto de las variables socioeconómicas corresponden al {XII} Censo de Población y Vivienda (2010), ambas a nivel de área geoestadística básica ({AGEB}). La metodología es mixta, para medir la relación espacial se aplicaron algunas técnicas de análisis regional como el cociente de localización, un modelo de regresión lineal múltiple y análisis exploratorio de datos espaciales en específico el Índice de Moran. Los resultados identifican cuatro variables tales como el uso del suelo no residencial, la densidad de población, los hogares con jefatura femenina y concentración de población joven como factores que influyen en el robo de vehículos. Lo anterior permite diseñar políticas públicas de seguridad centradas en los lugares en los que se puedan poner en marcha programas orientados a la prevención situacional del delito, así como la prevención social del delito, orientados a la reconstrucción del tejido social y organización comunitaria.Palabras clave  Robo de vehículos; patrón espacial; Distrito Federal},

Se construyeron indicadores aproximados al flujo de tránsito y se incluyeron dos variables: índice de jerarquía urbana y densidad de población. {RESULTADOS}: El valor de la autocorrelación espacial global fue positivo, indicando la presencia de agrupamientos que fueron identificados a través de los indicadores de asociación espacial. Existen clústeres de riesgo vial localizados en las zonas con una alta jerarquía intraurbana, baja densidad de población y un elevado flujo de tránsito. {CONCLUSIONES}: El análisis exploratorio de datos espaciales es una fase previa al uso de técnicas multivariadas de mayor alcance. La aplicación de las técnicas del análisis exploratorio por sí misma permite tipificar agrupamientos espaciales, identificar autocorrelación global e indicar la dirección de las variables en estudio.},

	abstract = {Crime opportunities are neither uniformly nor randomly organized in space and time. As a result, crime mappers can unlock these spatial patterns and strive for a better theoretical understanding of the role of geography and opportunity, as well as enabling practical crime prevention solutions that are tailored to specific places. The evolution of crime mapping has heralded a new era in spatial criminology, and a re-emergence of the importance of place as one of the cornerstones essential to an understanding of crime and criminality. While early criminological inquiry in France and Britain had a spatial component, much of mainstream criminology for the last century has labored to explain criminality from a dispositional perspective, trying to explain why a particular offender or group has a propensity to commit crime. This traditional perspective resulted in criminologists focusing on individuals or on communities where the community extended from the neighborhood to larger aggregations (Weisburd et al. 2004). Even when the results lacked ambiguity, the findings often lacked policy relevance. However, crime mapping has revived interest and reshaped many criminologists appreciation for the importance of local geography as a determinant of crime that may be as important as criminal motivation. Between the individual and large urban areas (such as cities and regions) lies a spatial scale where crime varies considerably and does so at a frame of reference that is often amenable to localized crime prevention techniques. For example, without the opportunity afforded by enabling environmental weaknesses, such as poorly lit streets, lack of protective surveillance, or obvious victims (such as overtly wealthy tourists or unsecured vehicles), many offenders would not be as encouraged to commit crime.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the probability density of the “anchor point” (residence, place of work, etc.) of a criminal offender given a set of observed spatial locations of crimes committed by the offender. Starting from kinetic models of criminal motion and target selection, we derive the probability density of anchor points using the Fokker–Planck equation and Bayes' theorem. Here, geographic inhomogeneities such as housing densities and geographic barriers (bodies of water, parks, etc.) are naturally incorporated into the probability density estimate, as well as directional bias and distance to crime preferences in offender target selection. The resulting equations are steady state advection-diffusion-reaction {PDEs}. We test our methodology against crime data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, and our results highlight the benefits of incorporating these elements of criminal behavior and geographic inhomogeneities into profiling estimates.},

	abstract = {The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition, especially in transportation or land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban design has brought its contribution by means of the ‘space syntax’ methodology. All these approaches-though under different terms like ‘accessibility’, ‘proximity’, ‘integration’ ‘connectivity’, ‘cost’, or ‘effort’-focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems, however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks such as social, biological, or technological ones. After a previous work on some structural properties of the primal graph representation of urban street networks, in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared with the dual one. We introduce multiple centrality assessment ({MCA}), a methodology for geographic network analysis, which is defined and implemented on four 1-square-mile urban street systems. {MCA} provides a different perspective from space syntax in that: (1) it is based on primal, rather than dual, street graphs; (2) it works within a metric, rather than topological, framework; (3) it investigates a plurality of peer centrality indices rather than a single index. We show that, in the {MCA} primal approach, much more than in the dual approach, some centrality indices nicely capture the ‘skeleton’ of the urban structure that impacts so much on spatial cognition and collective behaviours. Moreover, the distributions of centrality in self-organized cities are different from those in planned cities.},

In this paper, the author considers six cases of urban street networks characterized by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of a generalization model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the dual graphs, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that the absence of any clue of assortativity differentiates urban street networks from other non-geographic systems and that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.},
